# What

This is a assembler for a "hack" machine language from a Nand2Tetris Coursera course.

I believe there is nothing to see here.


# Disclaimer

I had to write a fair top-down parser probably. 
But it's too easy specs and not too much time to set up a state machine and to do things right.
It also the part of contract that there is NO invalid asm input.
I'm ok with this, I don't even have a Invalid token type in enum
